## Repository structure

The repository is organized with the following folders:

* `raw_data` contains all raw data extracted and manually pre-processed to generate the dataset. 
  See the inner [README](raw_data/README.md) for more detail on the extraction process

* `csv_data` contains the cvs files of the dataset

* `json_data` contains the json representation of the dataset

## Available data

There are two major sources of data:

* The daily positive persons and those in isolation (`provinces`), broken down by city (actually, by city of residence, so there is a small amount of persons accounted from other cities outside the region)

* The daily statistics for all the hospitals of the regions (`hospitals`). Those include:
  * daily hospitalized persons in non critical conditions;
  * daily persons in intensive care 
  * number of people discharged since the beginning (cumulative info)
  * number of deaths since the beginning (cumulative info)

## Data source

The data has been collected mostly from the daily reports by Regione Veneto that can be found on most local newspapers:

* L'Arena [daily updates](https://www.larena.it/territori/citt%C3%A0/verona-81-nuovi-casi-e-17-morti-nelle-ultime-24-ore-1.7976616)
